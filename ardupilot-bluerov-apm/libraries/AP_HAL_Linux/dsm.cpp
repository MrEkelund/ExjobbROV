 * Attempt to decode a single channel raw channel datum

 * so we detect dsm frame boundaries by the inter-dsm frame delay.
 *
 * The minimum dsm frame spacing is 11ms; with 16 bytes at 115200bps
 * dsm frame transmission time is ~1.4ms.
 *
 * We expect to only be called when bytes arrive for processing,
 * and if an interval of more than 5ms passes between calls,
 * the first byte we read will be the first byte of a dsm frame.
 *
 * In the case where byte(s) are dropped from a dsm frame, this also
 * provides a degree of protection. Of course, it would be better
 * if we didn't drop bytes...

 * @param[in] shift position of channel number in raw data
