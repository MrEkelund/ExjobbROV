function y = rad2pipi(angle);
% RAD2PIPI Converts an angle in rad to the interval (-pi pi]
%          Should be applied to all heading errors in a feedback control system
%          in order to avoid discontinuities.

% Revisions:  2004-09-02 Thor I. Fossen - replaced input argument x with angle
%             2005-01-05 Thor I. Fossen - ouput argument is set to y and not angle
%             2005-04-13 Roger Skjetne  - changed the function s in order
%                                         to account for correct mapping to
%                                         (-pi pi].
