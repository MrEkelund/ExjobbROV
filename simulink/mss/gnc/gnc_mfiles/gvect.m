function g = gvect(W,B,theta,phi,r_g,r_b)
% g = GVECT(W,B,theta,phi,r_g,r_b) computes the 6x1 vector of restoring 
% forces about an arbitrarily point CO for a submerged body. For floating 
% vessels, see Gmtrx.m
% 
% Inputs:  W, B: weight and buoyancy
%          phi,theta: roll and pitch angles
%          r_g = [x_g y_g z_g]: location of CG with respect to CO
%          r_b = [x_b y_b z_b]: location of CB with respect to CO
