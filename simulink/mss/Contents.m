% Marine Systems Simulator (MSS)
% 
% The MSS is a Matlab/Simulink library and simulator for marine systems. It
% includes models for ships, underwater vehicles and floating structures.
% The library also contains guidance, navigation and control (GNC) blocks
% for real-time simulation.   
%
% The MSS software has been developed at NTNU since 1991 as a joint effort
% between several professors, MSc and PhD students:
