First of all, would we like to thank our supervisor Jonas Linder for his support, inspirational ideas and for not being afraid to use his red ballpoint pen.

We would also like to thank Rikard Hagman and Combine for the opportunity to write this thesis.

We thank Albin and Cornelis for their company and the never ending supply of "quality" coffee.

Lastly, we would like to thank Ljungsbro fritidscenter and Linköpings simhall for letting us test the \abbrROV in their pools.
