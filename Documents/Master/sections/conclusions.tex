\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{cha:conclusions}
In this thesis, has an attitude model for a \abbrROV been estimated. The model has then been used in controller synthesis to get satisfactory performance from the controllers. This chapter discuss and summarise the results from \Chapterref{cha:modelling} - \Chapterref{cha:controller}. 
Lastly, is there a presentation of ideas for future work and development.
