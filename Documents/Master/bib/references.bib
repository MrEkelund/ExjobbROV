@article{Trajectory,
Abstract = {This work addresses the design, implementation and testing of a new precision guidance and control system for an inspection class remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A new multi-input multi-output control law, composed of a model-based equivalent control signal and two adaptive signals, is presented. In the controller, the first adaptive signal is a PID signal with a novel adaptation law that enhances the controller performance and allows efficient fine tuning of the controller. The second adaptive signal continuously estimates the upper bound on the lumped uncertainty vector and acts as a corrective term for the equivalent control law. A Lyapunov based guidance algorithm is implemented that can tolerate significant uncertainties in the system kinematics. The effectiveness of the system on an ROV is demonstrated through field trials in sheltered waters. For the experimental work, an extended Kalman filter is used to for navigation, blending the on-board sensor measurements wit},

@article{highgain,
Abstract = {This paper proposes a motion control system for observation class ROVs. It is essentially an output feedback control system composed of a MIMO PID controller, which is aided by reference feedforward, and a high-gain observer. Feedback linearisation of the plant dynamics is also performed. Four degrees-of-freedom are controlled (surge, sway, heave, and yaw). Stability and satisfactory performance are attained under suitable and smooth reference trajectories, despite the presence of unmodelled plant dynamics, plant parameter variations, measurement errors and noise, and environmental disturbances. Results from full-scale sea trials based on NTNU׳s ROV Minerva are presented and discussed.},
